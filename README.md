# Help the Rebels Find Their Lost Droids

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... The Rebel forces have lost track of their trusted droids R2D2 and BB8. These droids hold the secret plans and maps critical for the success of the Rebellion. 

We need all aspiring Jedi data padawans to use their nascent data skills to help locate these missing droids. You'll need to send out some decoy droid signals, parse any responses to extract flags that could reveal the droids' locations, and create a rebel dashboard to map possible droid sightings. 

Think you have what it takes to rescue R2D2 and BB8? Then grab your lightsaber and let the DataOps Jedi training begin!


## Prerequisites 

Before embarking on this epic quest, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Curl:** Equipped with this tool, you'll be ready to interact with APIs like a true Jedi.
- **Access To Purple**
   

## May the Flags Be With You

As you traverse the data galaxy, keep an eye out for the following flags:

1. **Test a Parser**: Let your Jedi instincts guide you as you test your parsing skills.
2. **Create a Dashboard**: Craft a dashboard worthy of the Jedi Council to showcase your triumphs. 
3. **Click Flags you Parsed**: Unveil the hidden flags and claim your rightful place among the data elite. (see below)

## Parsing Flags - Your Jedi Trials

In this exercise, you'll face your Jedi trials:

1. **Send Some Data Over**: Use your command over the Force to send data through the data pipeline. May the timestamps be in your favor!
  
```bash
curl --location 'https://xdr.us1.sentinelone.net/api/addEvents' \\
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ 
--header 'Cookie: sp=35eb6acb-d6cf-488d-a0ab-215e637e27db' \\
--data '{"token": "token-provided-on-data-ops-day", "session": "session_{{random_number}}", "sessionInfo": {"serverHost": "sko25", "logfile": "sko25"}, "events": [{"ts": "'$(($(date +%s%N) - 5*60*60*1000000000))'", "attrs": {"message": "{\"flag\":\"BB8-'$USER'\", \"description\": \"these are the droids you\''re looking for\", \"User\": \""${USER/@*}"\"}", "parser": "sko25-"'${USER/@*}'"}}, {"ts": "'$(($(date +%s%N)))'", "attrs": {"message": "user=\'"$USER"\',flag=R2D2-'$USER',description=These are the droids you\''re looking for,code=200", "parser": "sko25-"'${USER/@*}'", "field 1": "x", "field 2": "y"}}]}'  
```

2. **Find the Unparsed Data**: Your Jedi senses will guide you to the unparsed data. Seek, and you shall find!

3. **Apply a Parser**: With the wisdom of Yoda, apply the JSON parser to unlock the secrets hidden within the data.

4. **Click the "Flag" to Go on the Leaderboard**: Prove your worth by clicking the "Flag" and ascending to the ranks of the Jedi Masters.

5. **Click the First Flag**: Encounter friendly droids and unlock the mysteries of the Force.
